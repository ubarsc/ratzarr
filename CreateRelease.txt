How to create a release of ratzarr.
You will need the build package installed ("conda install build" or
"pip install build").

1. Make sure that the doc HTML has been updated (see Docs.txt).
   Make sure everything has been merged. 
2. Merge a pull request to update the version number in ratzarr.py
3. Create the distribution tar.gz using
        python -m build
   This creates a tar.gz file under a subdirectory called dist/
        e.g. ratzarr-1.0.1.tar.gz
4. Go to https://github.com/ubarsc/ratzarr/releases, and create
   a new release by pressing "Draft a new release".
   You should fill in the following:
    Tag version: <version number> e.g. 1.0.1
    Release Title: Version 1.0.1
    Description: A brief description (a few lines at most) explaining
                 the key points about this release
    Upload files: Add the tar.gz file
    Click "Publish release"
